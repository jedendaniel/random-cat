Random cat - application to display random cat picture stored in database.

Very basic version 0.1.0
- setup S3 bucket with manually uploaded cat pics
- app read random pic on demand
    -- app pics random picture first time it is requested and for whole day returns only this pic
- frontend - spring mvc with thymeleaf

Future versions:
- create user accounts
- premium version
    -- second pic available (similar to first one - same single selected picture for all users)
    -- ask to pay for charity
    -- pay me?! I mean support creator
- introduce more cats
    - premium: allow to choose a cat

Be careful versions:
- users upload their pics - make it restricted, under review so db does not blow up, or if user paid?
- videos?
