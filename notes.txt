Random cat - application to display random cat picture stored in database.

Very basic version 0.1.0
- setup S3 bucket with manually uploaded cat pics
- app read random pic on demand
- frontend - vaadin, just single button and place for displaying pic

Future versions:
- create user accounts and restrict user to display only single pic per day
- premium version
    -- ask to pay for charity
    -- pay me?! I mean support creator
- videos

Be careful versions:
- users upload their pics - make it restricted, under review so db does not blow up, or if user paid?
